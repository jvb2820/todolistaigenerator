# 📌 JV's TodoList AI Generator

## 🌐 Overview  
JV's TodoList AI Generator is a modern, AI-powered task management application designed to help you organize your life with creativity and intelligence. Built with React and TypeScript, it reimagines the traditional to-do list as a collection of visually distinct "papers." The core feature is its deep integration with Google's Gemini AI, allowing users to instantly generate themed task lists, making planning effortless and fun. The app is fully responsive, saves all data to local storage, and even lets you export your papers as images.
